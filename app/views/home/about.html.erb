      <h3>Andy M. Denenberg</h3>
		<p>A seasoned entrepreneur, Andy has been leading innovative companies for over 20 years.  Andy is a technologist at heart with a passion for great design and simple, cost effective solutions.   In building both products and companies, Andy has learned that all outstanding companies start with superior products, but economic success comes from integrated operations.  To be financially successful and therefore in control of its own destiny, a company’s management needs to balance its attention and resources across all aspects of its business.
